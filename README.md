# AI Tweet Classifier

## Overview
This project uses Tweepy to fetch tweets and a neural network to classify whether a tweet is generated by AI.

# Model Architecture
Embedding Layer: Transforms input into dense vectors.
LSTM Layers: Capture dependencies in sequences.
Dense Layer: Outputs probability of being AI-generated.
# Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using the evaluate method, which prints a classification report.
